# Features
Emulator startup with/without rom prepicked (depends on the emulator).
Under heavy development!

# Installation
You should use the [yocto based opendreambox distribution](http://git.opendreambox.org/?p=opendreambox.git;a=summary) to install this on your Box.

For developing and/or testing before official release you can copy it manually to your dreambox like any other python plugin.
